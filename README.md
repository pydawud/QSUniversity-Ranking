# QS University Ranking 2023 Exploration

## Dataset

The [QS World University Rankings 2023](https://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/world-university-rankings/2023) feature over 1,400 universities from around the world, Institutions are assessed across six categories (or indicators) to effectively capture university performance. The dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jkanthony/world-university-rankings-202223)

## Summary of Findings

In the Exploration, Among the six ranking indicators (ar score, er score, ifr score, isr score, cpf score, and fsr score), I have found that out of the 1400 Universities ranked, The United State (US) has more Universities ranked (201) than the United Kingdom (UK) with 90 Universities, and Canada (CN) with 70 Universities on the ranking list. There's a correlation between academic reputation and employment reputation of a particular universisty, where's those that get higher ar score and er score tend to have a better ranking and Universities in the UK have better ar score and er score ranking compare to the US and the Canada. There's also a relationship between International Student ratio (isr score) and International faculty ratio (ifr) with UK varsities lead with good score on the scoreboard.

## Key Insights for Presentation
During the presentation, I focus on the effect of the key indicators in University ranking, I started with the proportion of ranked universities in the top 3 most countries with rated Universities in the world (US, UK, and Canada). Plot the distributions of each ranking indicators, observed possible relationship among indicators.
Secondly, I observed some relationship of these indicators with respect to the University location, and the world ranking.
I make sure that all design integrity are met.
